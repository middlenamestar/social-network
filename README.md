# Social Network API

This application demonstrates an API using MongoDB. With a social network framework, users can manuever API routes to post thoughts, reactions, add/remove friends, create user accounts, and more.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local, run `npm i` to install dependencies, and then `npm start` or `nodemon server.js` to start the server.

## Usage

After the server is started, run Insomnia to get a feel for all of the routes.
